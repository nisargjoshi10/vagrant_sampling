# E(3) Equivariant Translation VAE for 3D Molecular Design
This repo contains the training and generation code for the model described in the paper, _"Efficient 3D Molecular Design with an E(3) Invariant Transformer VAE"_.

## Installation

We build the model architecture of Vagrant using PyTorch. Certain functions depend on [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html) and we use [Morfeus](https://kjelljorner.github.io/morfeus/installation.html) for conformer generation. We also use standard python packages `numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and scipy`. Otherwise the repo is entirely self-contained.

## Data

The training script automatically downloads the QM9 dataset and stores it in `qm9/temp/qm9` the first time it is run. You can force a redownload by adding the `--force_download` argument or reprocess the data by adding the `--reprocess_data` argument. We also include a pretrained checkpoint file in `checkpoints/vagrant`.

## Training

To train a model, run the following code in a terminal `python scripts/train.py`. The default hyperparameters match the hyperparameters used to train the version of Vagrant reported in the submission.

## Generation

You can generate molecules by calling `python scripts/gen.py --name vagrant --ckpt_epoch 100`. The `--name` and `--ckpt_epoch` arguments are rquired. Additional options can be passed to select a sampling method or additional hyperparameters. For instance, to use robust sampling and calculate the coherence of each sample, you would call `python scripts/gen.py --name vagrant --ckpt_epoch 100 --sample_method robust --calc_coherence`.

## Conformers

We also include code for generating structural conformers from the sampled molecules. These functions can be found in `vagrant/conformers.py`. Generating conformers for some samples can be slow. This may be the case when calculating coherence and can some times cause errors during generation.
